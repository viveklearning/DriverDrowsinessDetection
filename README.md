The project uses the following libraries:

OpenCV: A computer vision library that is used for image processing and video analysis.
Dlib: A library for face detection and facial landmark detection.
Python: A programming language that is used for the development of the project.
The project works by first detecting the face of the driver using OpenCV. Once the face is detected, the 68 facial landmarks are identified using Dlib. These landmarks are used to calculate the eye aspect ratio (EAR), which is a measure of how open the eyes are. If the EAR falls below a certain threshold, it is an indication that the driver is drowsy.

Once the driver is detected as drowsy, an alert is generated. The alert can be a visual alert, such as a flashing light, or an audio alert, such as a buzzer. The alert can also be used to trigger other actions, such as turning on the car's hazard lights or sending a message to the driver's phone.

The project can be improved in a number of ways. For example, the EAR threshold can be adjusted to be more sensitive or less sensitive. The project can also be extended to detect other signs of drowsiness, such as yawning or nodding off.

The project is a valuable tool for preventing driver drowsiness. Drowsy driving is a serious problem that can lead to accidents. The project can help to keep drivers awake and alert, and it can help to prevent accidents.
